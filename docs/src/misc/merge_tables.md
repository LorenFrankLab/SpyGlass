# Merge Tables

## Why

A pipeline may diverge when we want to process the same data in different ways.
Merge Tables allow us to join divergent pipelines together, and unify
downstream processing steps. For a more in depth discussion, please refer to
[this notebook](https://github.com/ttngu207/db-programming-with-datajoint/blob/master/notebooks/pipelines_merging_design_master_part.ipynb)
and related discussions [here](https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint-python/issues/151)
and [here](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass/issues/469).

**Note:** Deleting entries upstream of Merge Tables will throw errors related to
deleteing a part entry before the master. To circumvent this, you can add
`force_parts=True` to the
[`delete` function](https://datajoint.com/docs/core/datajoint-python/0.14/api/datajoint/__init__/#datajoint.table.Table.delete)
call, but this will leave and orphaned primary key in the master. Instead, use
`spyglass.utils.dj_merge_tables.delete_downstream_merge` to delete master/part pairs.

## What

A Merge Table is fundametally a master table with one part for each divergent
pipeline. By convention...

1. The master table has one primary key, `merge_id`, a 
   [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier), and one
   secondary attribute, `source`, which gives the part table name. Both are 
   managed with the custom `insert` function of this class. 

2. Each part table has inherits the final table in its respective pipeline, and
   shares the same name as this table.

```python
from spyglass.utils.dj_merge_tables import Merge

@schema
class MergeTable(Merge):
    definition = """
    merge_id: uuid
    ---
    source: varchar(32)
    """

    class One(dj.Part):
        definition = """
        -> master
        ---
        -> One
        """

    class Two(dj.Part):
        definition = """
        -> master
        ---
        -> Two
        """
```

## How

The Merge class in Spyglass's utils is a subclass of DataJoint's
[Manual Table](https://datajoint.com/docs/core/design/tables/tiers/#data-entry-lookup-and-manual)
and adds functions to make the awkwardness of part tables more manageable. These
functions are described in the API section, under `utils.dj_merge_tables`.

One quirk of these utilites is that they take restrictions as agruments, rather
than with operators. So `Table & "field='value'"` becomes 
`MergeTable.merge_view(restriction="field='value'"`)`. This is because 
`merge_view` is a `Union` rather than a true Table.

## Example 

First, we'll import various items related to the LFP Merge Table...

```python
from spyglass.utils.dj_merge_tables import delete_downstream_merge, Merge
from spyglass.common.common_ephys import LFP as CommonLFP  # Upstream 1
from spyglass.lfp.lfp_merge import LFPOutput  # Merge Table
from spyglass.lfp.v1.lfp import LFPV1  # Upstream 2
```

Merge Tables have multiple custom methods that begin with `merge`. `help` can 
show us the docstring of each

```python
merge_methods=[d for d in dir(Merge) if d.startswith('merge')]
help(getattr(Merge,merge_methods[-1]))
```

We'll use this example to explore populating both `LFPV1` and the `LFPOutput`
Merge Table.

```python
nwb_file_dict = { # We'll use this later when fetching from the Merge Table
    "nwb_file_name": "tonks20211103_.nwb",
}
lfpv1_key = {
    **nwb_file_dict,
    "lfp_electrode_group_name": "CA1_test",
    "target_interval_list_name": "test interval2",
    "filter_name": "LFP 0-400 Hz",
    "filter_sampling_rate": 30000,
}
LFPV1.populate(lfpv1_key)  # Also populates LFPOutput
```

The Merge Table can also be populated with keys from `common_ephys.LFP`.

```python
common_keys = CommonLFP.fetch(limit=3, as_dict=True)
LFPOutput.insert1(common_keys[0], skip_duplicates=True)
LFPOutput.insert(common_keys[1:], skip_duplicates=True)
```

`merge_view` shows a union of the master and all part tables.

```python
LFPOutput.merge_view()
LFPOutput.merge_view(restriction=lfpv1_key)
```

UUIDs help retain unique entries across all part tables. We can fetch NWB file
by referencing this or other features.

```python
uuid_key = LFPOutput.fetch(limit=1, as_dict=True)[-1]
restrict = LFPOutput & uuid_key
result1 = restrict.fetch_nwb()

nwb_key = LFPOutput.merge_restrict(nwb_file_dict).fetch(as_dict=True)[0]
result2 = (LFPOutput & nwb_key).fetch_nwb()
```

When deleting from Merge Tables, we can either... 

1. delete from the Merge Table itself with `merge_delete`_parent, deleting both
   the master and part. 
2. use `merge_delete_parent` to delete from the parent sources, getting rid of
   the entries in the source table they came from.
3. use `delete_downstream_merge` to find Merge Tables downstream and get rid 
   full entries, avoiding orphaned master table entries. 

The two latter cases can be destructive, so we include an extra layer of
protection with `dry_run`. When true (by default), these functions return 
a list of tables with the entries that would otherwise be deleted. 

```python
LFPOutput.merge_delete(common_keys[0])  # Delete from merge table
LFPOutput.merge_delete_parent(restriction=nwb_file_dict, dry_run=True)
delete_downstream_merge(
    table=CommonLFP, restriction=common_keys[0], dry_run=True
)
```
