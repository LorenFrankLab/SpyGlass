# This file should live in the SPYGLASS BASE directory.

# This YAML will be used to populate spyglass tables when the spyglass.common module is loaded.
# This is an easy way to populate the tables, especially with controlled vocabularies.
# This helps ensure that a preferred term or definition is used, e.g. "SpikeGadgets" and not "spikegadgets",
# and Neuropixels 1.0 is defined with a particular (x,y) layout and not another (x,y) layout.
# Each item under the table name is read as an entry (entity) to be added.
# Duplicates (entries where the primary key already exists in the table) are skipped.
# Only Manual and Lookup tables can be populated this way.
# Part tables cannot be populated this way.
# All required fields for a table must be provided. Optional fields are optional.
