# This file should live in the SPYGLASS BASE directory.

# This YAML is used to populate spyglass tables when the spyglass.common module is loaded.
# This is an easy way to populate the tables, especially with controlled vocabularies.
# This helps ensure that a preferred term or definition is used, e.g. "SpikeGadgets" and not "spikegadgets",
# and Neuropixels 1.0 is defined with a particular (x,y) layout and not another (x,y) layout.
# Each item under the table name is read as an entry (entity) to be added to that table.
# Duplicates (entries where the primary key already exists in the table) are skipped, so this YAML file can be used
# to reload the same entries repeatedly.
# Only Manual, Lookup tables can be populated this way.
# All required fields for a table must be provided. Optional fields are optional.
# This YAML should be edited by hand only very carefully because the foreign keys have to be set up and referenced
# just right. Often, it is simply better to add these entries programmatically.
