* Figure out how to delete orphan tables on datajoint
  * Done: try connecting and dropping via virtual module; else delete log, data, and the offending folders in docker dir
  * This approach may need to be adopted for the main server
* Test the current pipeline
* Finish artifact detection pipeline
* Figure out how to propagate timestamps for recordings with multiple disjoint segments
  * Had a chat with Alessio and Samuel about this
  * proposed solution: write a new function that can split the concatenated recording back to individual parts; then get the times from them
* Decide the merge and reject algorithms
